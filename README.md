dream86, the x86/PC emulator dedicated to my father.<br/>
When I was young, he bought a 386sx with MS-DOS 3.30 as OS. dream86 is capable of running MS-DOS 3.30; it was the 1st OS that it booted. It took many nights of painstaking debugging, but, at the end, it's here.<br/>
<br/>
dream86 is written in Rust. It's an experiment. I started using this language in December 2021, participating to Advent Of Code and trying to learn a new language.
