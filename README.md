dream86, the x86/PC emulator dedicated to my father.<br/><br/>

When I was young, he bought a 386sx with MS-DOS 3.30.<br/>
dream86 is capable of running MS-DOS 3.30; it was the 1st OS that it booted. It took many nights of painstaking debugging, but, at the end, it's here.<br/>
<br/>
dream86 is written in Rust. It's an experiment. I started using this language in December 2021, when I was searching for a different language to do Advent Of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). I'm not proficient in this language, but at least now I know that you have to run "cargo run --release" if you want an executable that is not a snail.
